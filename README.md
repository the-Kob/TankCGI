# Tank
I made this project for the uni course CGI. All of the libs were provided by my professor, [Fernando Birra](https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/pessoas/docentes/fernando-pedro-reino-da-silva-birra), with the exception of the file prism.js, which I made.

## Intructions
There are two ways to run the project.
The first is to access it through [here](https://the-kob.github.io/TankCGI/).

The second I advise using VSCode, since we used a plugin called Live Share to run the application on our browsers. After downloading the plugin, right click the index.html file and choose "Open with Live Share". The project will open in your browser.
